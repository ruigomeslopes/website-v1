## First Impressions

When I started Baldur's Gate 3, I had high expectations - after all, the hype was real. But nothing prepared me for the **absurd depth** this game offers. We're looking at what might be, without exaggeration, **the best RPG since The Witcher 3**.

## Gameplay: Absolute Freedom

### Combat System (10/10)

Turn-based combat based on D&D 5th Edition rules is simply **perfect**. Every encounter is a tactical puzzle with dozens of possible solutions.

### Roleplay and Choices (10/10)

Here's the real magic. **Every decision matters**. You're not forced to be "the hero" - the game **respects and adapts** to your choices.

## Story and Characters

### Companions (10/10)

Extraordinarily well-written companions with complex personal quests, available romances, and character development.

## World and Exploration (10/10)

Larian created an absolutely stunning version of Faerûn with living cities, vertical dungeons, and secrets in every corner.

## Pros & Cons
