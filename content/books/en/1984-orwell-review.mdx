# 1984: Dystopically Current

**Author**: George Orwell | **Pages**: 328 | **Genre**: Dystopia

**Rating**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

---

## Why It Remains Relevant

Re-reading 1984 in 2025 is a disturbing experience. Orwell wasn't writing science fiction - he was issuing a **prophetic warning**:

- **Constant Surveillance**: Cameras, facial recognition, online tracking
- **Truth Manipulation**: Fake news, alternative facts, filter bubbles
- **Newspeak**: Controlling language to control thought

## Verdict

**1984** isn't a pleasant read - it's a **necessary** one. Orwell created the manual for identifying totalitarianism.

**Essential for anyone who wants to understand the dangers of absolute power.**

**Final Rating**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) - ESSENTIAL
