# Portugal 3-1 France: Ronaldo Hat-Trick Destroys World Champions

**Portugal 3-1 France | UEFA Nations League | Estádio da Luz | March 25, 2022**

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Rating: 5/5**

---

## The Context: Revenge Served Cold 🇵🇹

We still had the trauma of Euro 2020 fresh in our memory. France eliminated Portugal in the round of 16 with a Pogba goal at 78 minutes. It hurt. A lot. But this was our chance for revenge, at home, at Estádio da Luz completely sold out with 65 thousand fans singing the Portuguese anthem like never before. 🎵

France arrived as World Cup runners-up (lost the 2022 final to Argentina), and Portugal needed points to maintain Nations League aspirations. But forget statistics - this match was about pride, about showing we deserved more at the Euros. And we had Cristiano Ronaldo. At 37 years old, still proving the "old guys" rule. 👑

## First Half: CR7 Show Begins 🚀

**Minute 9 - GOAL PORTUGAL! Ronaldo (pen)! 1-0**

Early penalty after Upamecano brought down Otávio in the box. Cristiano steps up and hammers it to Lloris' left. The keeper guessed right but the ball had too much power. CR7 runs to the corner, does the "Siuuuuu" and 65 thousand people scream with him. Goosebumps! This man is addicted to big moments! 🔥

**Minute 31 - GOAL FRANCE! Benzema! 1-1**

The equalizer came from world-class individual play. Griezmann steals from Danilo, advances and passes to Benzema at the edge of the box. The Frenchman does that magical back-heel of his, leaves Pepe on the ground (literally!) and shoots across goal. Unstoppable.

What a player Benzema is. Well-deserved 2022 Ballon d'Or. But there was still a lot of game left... 😏

**Minute 42 - GOAL PORTUGAL! Ronaldo again! 2-1**

YEEEES! And what a goal! Bruno Fernandes launches long from the left, high ball into the box. Cristiano jumps with Varane (who's 1.91m!), jumps HIGHER than him (how?!?!), and powers a header into the net. Lloris didn't even jump - knew he wouldn't reach it.

**Ronaldo at 37 years old jumps 78cm high**. Let that sink in for a second. Cristiano celebrates pointing to the Portugal crest. Captain! Estádio da Luz was in total delirium! 🇵🇹⚽

## Second Half: Historic Hat-Trick 🎩

**Minute 52 - Mbappé wastes CLEAR chance**

Huge scare! Theo Hernández launches Mbappé behind the Portuguese defense. The Frenchman is ALONE with Diogo Costa, has time to think, but shoots weak and the keeper saves with his feet. Phew! If that was a goal, everything would've changed. 😰

**Minute 61 - Portugal controls the game**

Fernando Santos was directing from the touchline for the team to manage possession better. Bernardo Silva started commanding midfield like a maestro. France looked tired, frustrated. Portugal was comfortable for the first time in the match.

**Minute 79 - GOAL PORTUGAL! RONALDO! HAT-TRICK! 3-1**

HATTTTTTTT-TRIIIIIIIICK! And what a goal to seal it! Rafael Leão steals ball in midfield (beautiful high press), runs 40 meters at speed, enters the box, Upamecano stops him but the ball falls to RONALDO who was following the play. CR7 shoots first-time, across goal, no chance for Lloris.

GOOOAL! Cristiano takes off his shirt (gets yellow, but who cares?!), shows off his 37-year-old abs that look like 25, and celebrates with teammates. Hat-trick against France. LEGENDARY! Estádio da Luz was chanting "RONALDO! RONALDO! RONALDO!" 🐐👑🔥

**Final Minutes:**

Portugal controlled with maturity. Fernando Santos even took off Cristiano at 85' for a standing ovation from the entire stadium - French fans included (fair-play). When the final whistle blew, the party was complete!

## Tactical Analysis 📊

### Fernando Santos' Plan ✅

**What worked:**
- **Ronaldo as reference** - 3 goals, constant movement
- **High press with Leão and Otávio** - Recovered 6 balls in attacking third
- **Bernardo Silva free** - Commanded midfield in second half
- **Defensive solidity** - Pepe (39 years!) and Rúben Dias neutralized Mbappé
- **João Cancelo vs Mbappé** - Balanced duel, Cancelo held well

### What failed for Deschamps? ❌

- **Upamecano nervous** - Penalty + ball lost in 3rd goal
- **Lack of physical intensity** - Portugal won 60% of duels
- **Mbappé isolated** - Only 3 touches in the box in 90 minutes
- **Late substitutions** - Changes only at 72', too late

## Individual Ratings ⭐

**Portugal:**
- **Cristiano Ronaldo:** 10/10 - HAT-TRICK! At 37! Living legend!
- **Bruno Fernandes:** 9/10 - Assist and total game control
- **Bernardo Silva:** 8/10 - Maestro in midfield
- **Pepe:** 8/10 - 39 years old and still imperial
- **Rafael Leão:** 8/10 - Frightening speed, stole ball for 3rd goal
- **Diogo Costa:** 7/10 - Two important saves vs Mbappé

**France:**
- **Benzema:** 8/10 - World-class goal, but insufficient
- **Lloris:** 6/10 - Could've done better on 2nd goal
- **Mbappé:** 5/10 - Wasted 1v1, little influence
- **Upamecano:** 4/10 - Night to forget (penalty + error on 3rd)

## Historic Moment for CR7 🐐

With this hat-trick, Cristiano Ronaldo reached:
- **117 goals for the National Team** (absolute world record!)
- **10th hat-trick for Portugal**
- **60 goals in "important" matches** (qualifiers, finals)

At 37 years old, against world champions, at home. If anyone still doubts this man's greatness, I don't know what else to say. We're lucky to live in the Cristiano Ronaldo era. 👑🇵🇹

## Final Verdict 🎯

What a night! Portugal showed that, when playing at their best level, they can beat any team in the world. Fernando Santos got the tactics right. Cristiano Ronaldo was Cristiano Ronaldo. The defense was solid. And the midfield commanded the game.

This result reignited hopes for the 2022 World Cup (where unfortunately we fell in the quarters against Morocco, but that's a story for another article 😅). For this night, we celebrate. PORTUGAL! PORTUGAL! PORTUGAL! 🇵🇹🔴🟢

**Final Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)**

**Recommended for:** All Portuguese need to watch this match. And all Cristiano Ronaldo fans worldwide. Hat-trick at 37 against France? Pure cinema. Look for the highlights on YouTube and enjoy. This is football history! ⚽🐐
