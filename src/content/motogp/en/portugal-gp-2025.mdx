## The Race

### Start: Immediate Drama

The start at Portimão was absolutely chaotic. **Bagnaia** got an excellent launch from pole position, but **Márquez**, starting from 3rd, executed an aggressive overtake in turn 1, almost touching the Italian.

**Martín** also came in strong, gaining a position on **Bastianini**, establishing a top 3 that would remain stable during the first 10 laps.

### Laps 1-15: Bagnaia in Control

Pecco Bagnaia led with authority in the early laps, showing impressive pace especially in sectors 2 and 3. His **Ducati GP25** was absolutely glued to the Portimão asphalt.

**Lap times** (lap 8 comparison):
- Bagnaia: **1:38.432**
- Márquez: **1:38.589** (+0.157s)
- Martín: **1:38.891** (+0.459s)

Márquez followed 0.4s behind, studying his opponent, looking for the right moment to attack.

### Laps 16-20: Márquez's Pressure

From lap 16 onwards, Márquez started to intensify the pressure. He managed to stick to Bagnaia's wheel, using the slipstream on the main straight (325 km/h!) to position himself for the attack.

**Lap 18**: First overtaking attempt at turn 5. Bagnaia closes the door tightly but cleanly.

**Lap 19**: Second attempt, same corner. Bagnaia defends again. The battle was heating up!

### Lap 21: The Decisive Overtake

On lap 21, Márquez finally succeeded. Late braking into turn 1, inside line, clean overtake. **Bagnaia tried to respond immediately** at turn 5, but Márquez already had the better line.

From here, Marc gave no chances. Increased the pace to **1:38.2xx**, creating a 0.3s gap that he maintained until the end.

### Last 4 Laps: Bagnaia Tries the Impossible

Pecco didn't give up. In the last laps, he threw everything at the attack, reducing the gap to 0.1s on the final straight. The last lap was breathtaking:

- Márquez on the defensive, making the perfect line
- Bagnaia trying to overtake at turn 13 (unsuccessfully)
- Final sprint to the line with Márquez holding by **0.087 seconds**!

## Technical Analysis

### Tires

Both leaders opted for **medium front + soft rear**. The difference was in management:

- **Márquez**: Saved rubber in early laps, had more grip at the end
- **Bagnaia**: Attacked from the start, rear tire started sliding on lap 20

### Setup

Márquez chose a more aggressive setup for sector 1 (fast direction-change corners), while Bagnaia favored stability in sectors 2 and 3.

Márquez's choice proved victorious, allowing him to gain crucial tenths in sector 1.

### Telemetry Data (Lap 21 - Overtaking Lap)

| Sector | Márquez | Bagnaia | Difference |
|--------|---------|---------|------------|
| Sector 1 | 27.156s | 27.298s | **-0.142s** ⚡ |
| Sector 2 | 33.789s | 33.723s | +0.066s |
| Sector 3 | 37.421s | 37.398s | +0.023s |
| **Total** | **1:38.366** | **1:38.419** | **-0.053s** |

Márquez was devastating in sector 1, compensating for losses in the following sectors.
