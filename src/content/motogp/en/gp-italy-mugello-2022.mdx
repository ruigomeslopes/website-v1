## The Context: Italian Pressure at Mugello 🇮🇹

Mugello is sacred for Italians. A legendary circuit in Tuscany, with fast corners, long straights and 110 thousand tifosi vibrating with every Ducati acceleration. Bagnaia arrived with enormous pressure: Ducati hadn't won at home since 2018 (Dovizioso), and "Pecco" was 8 points behind Quartararo in the championship.

The atmosphere was electric. Red Ducati flags everywhere, fans camping since Friday, and maximum expectation. If there's a circuit where Ducati NEEDS to win, it's Mugello. But pressure makes diamonds... or breaks riders. 💎

## The Race: Total Show! 🔥

### Lap 1 - Chaotic Start

Quartararo maintains lead into turn 1, but Bagnaia gains THREE positions in the first lap! From 5th to 2nd in an instant. San Donato (turn 1) was madness - ultra-late braking, bikes side by side. The Ducatis were hunting! ⚡

### Lap 9 - OVERTAKE! Bagnaia leads! 🇮🇹

FINALLY! Bagnaia waited for the perfect moment. Exiting Scarperia corner, opened throttle earlier, gained advantage on the Mugello straight and dove inside at San Donato. Clean overtake, aggressive, perfect!

Mugello EXPLODED! 110 thousand people on their feet, screaming "PECCO! PECCO! PECCO!" Total goosebumps. 🔴

### Laps 19-23 - Management and Final Glory

Bagnaia opened slight advantage (0.8s) and began managing. Quartararo tried everything on the last lap, but Pecco didn't tremble. Defended, accelerated on the final straight, and crossed the line with 0.635s advantage.

VICTORY! Bagnaia raised his fist still on the bike, then stopped, Italian flag in hand, tears in eyes. The Ducati team ran to the parabolic curve to celebrate. Mugello in absolute ecstasy! 🏆🇮🇹
