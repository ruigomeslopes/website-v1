## Analysis

### Cillian Murphy's Performance (10/10)

Murphy delivers the **performance of a lifetime**. His eyes capture Oppenheimer's complexity: brilliance, arrogance, remorse.

### Direction and Non-Linear Narrative

Nolan tells the story through three intertwined timelines - confusing initially, but **brilliant** when it comes together.

## Themes

**"Now I am become Death, destroyer of worlds"**

The film questions: does science have moral responsibility? Nolan doesn't give easy answers.

## Verdict

**Oppenheimer** is Nolan at his best: ambitious, intellectually stimulating, visually epic.

**Essential. Best film of 2023.**

**Rating**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)
