# Dune: Part Two - Definitive Epic

**Director:** Denis Villeneuve | **Runtime:** 166 min | **Watched:** Cinema
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Rating: 5/5**

---

Part One was setup. **Part Two is total PAYOFF!** 🏜️🔥

**Epic scale:** Sandworm riding = cinematic moment of the year! IMAX was religious experience. 🪱

**Performances:** Timothée evolves from boy to Messiah. Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha = terrifying. 💪

**Action:** Final battles are BRUTAL.

**Verdict:** **Empire Strikes Back of this generation.** Darker, more epic, better than Part One. 🏆

Saw 2x in cinema. Will see 3rd time. This is cinematic EVENT!

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **(5/5)** - Absolute masterpiece. IMAX is MANDATORY!
