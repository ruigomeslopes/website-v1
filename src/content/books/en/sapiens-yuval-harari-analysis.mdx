# Sapiens: A Journey Through Human History

**Author:** Yuval Noah Harari | **Pages:** 443 | **Read:** June 2023

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Rating: 5/5**

---

Sapiens remains incredibly relevant. In a world of fake news and polarization, understanding **how we got here** has never been more important. 🌍

---

## The Three Revolutions 🔥

Harari structures human history into 3 revolutions:

**1. Cognitive Revolution (70,000 years ago)**
We developed complex language and ability to create **shared fictions**. Religions, nations, corporations - all are stories we collectively BELIEVE. Mind-blowing! 🧠

**2. Agricultural Revolution (12,000 years ago)**
Harari argues it was **"humanity's biggest mistake"** (!). We traded hunter-gatherer freedom for hard work and disease. Provocative but fascinating. 🌾

**3. Scientific Revolution (500 years ago)**
We accepted our ignorance and started experimenting. Science + capitalism + empire = modern world. 🔬

## Ideas That Made Me Stop and Think 💭

**"Money is humanity's most successful fiction"**
We all trust colored paper because... we collectively agreed to trust it. Amazing when you think about it. 💵

**"Happiness hasn't increased with progress"**
We have smartphones and planes, but are we happier than hunter-gatherers? Harari says: probably not. 😅

---

## Final Verdict 📖

Sapiens genuinely changed how I think about humanity, progress, future. **A book doesn't need to be 100% right to be valuable**. It needs to make you think. And Sapiens does that perfectly. 🌟

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **(5/5)** - Essential reading!
