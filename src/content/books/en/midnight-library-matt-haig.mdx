# The Midnight Library: About Regrets and Second Chances

**Author:** Matt Haig | **Pages:** 304 | **Read:** December 2022
⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Rating: 4/5**

---

Nora Seed wants to die. But instead, she lands in the Midnight Library - magical library where each book is an alternative life. What if she'd made different choices? 🌟

**Loved:** Brilliant concept. Powerful message: "Perfect life doesn't exist. But THIS life can be good." 💙

**Could improve:** Predictable. Sometimes superficial.

**Verdict:** Not literary masterpiece, but **exactly what you need when you're down**. Read in December 2022 (difficult time) and genuinely helped. 📖❤️

⭐⭐⭐⭐ **(4/5)** - Recommended for those needing hope!
