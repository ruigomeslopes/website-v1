# Marvel's Spider-Man 2: Guaranteed Fun Without Big Surprises

**Platform:** PS5 | **Developer:** Insomniac Games | **Release:** 2023

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Rating: 8/10**

🏆 **PLATINUM ACHIEVED!** | **28 hours played**

---

Spider-Man 2 is exactly what you expected: **more Spider-Man**. If you loved the first two games (Spider-Man 2018 + Miles Morales), you'll love this. And I'm 100% ok with that! 🎮

---

## Two Spider-Men, Double Fun 🕷️🕷️

The big novelty: you play as **Peter Parker AND Miles Morales** alternating during the campaign!

**Peter:**
- Stronger, experienced
- Symbiote powers (Venom tentacles!) = BRUTAL 😈
- Web Wings (gliders!) = GAME CHANGER

**Miles:**
- More agile, fast
- Electric Venom powers
- Invisibility (OP stealth!)

---

## Venom Is The Best Villain ☠️

No spoilers: **Venom in this game is SCARY**. Tony Todd (Candyman!) does the voice and is absolutely perfect. Final boss fight against Venom? Top 3 best in Spider-Man games. Epic! 😱💪

---

## Improved New York 🗽

**Brooklyn and Queens now accessible!** Map is 2x larger than Spider-Man 2018.

**Web Wings:** Gliders that completely changed traversal. Web-swinging + gliding = feeling REALLY like Spider-Man! Best movement in any superhero game. 🌆

**28h for Platinum** - Quick but satisfying!

---

## Platinum: Easy and Fun 🏆

**Difficulty: 4/10** | **Time: 28h**

All trophies are easy. Perfect for relaxing! 😊

---
