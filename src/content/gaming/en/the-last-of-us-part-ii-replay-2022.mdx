## Context: Why I Played Again in 2022? 🤔

When I played TLOU2 in June 2020 (launch), I hated it. Yes, HATED IT. I was furious with narrative choices, certain early events, and game structure. Gave it 6/10 and swore never to play again.

But in August 2022, after talking with friends who loved it, I decided to give it a second chance. The native PS5 version with 60fps had released, and I was in a different mindset. Would my opinion change? ⚠️

**SPOILER:** It did. Completely. 😭

## Story: About Revenge, Forgiveness and Humanity 📖

**Rating: 9/10** (up from 5/10 on first playthrough!)

The Last of Us Part II is about revenge. Ellie suffers a devastating loss at the start (that event that enraged half the internet) and sets out on a revenge journey. Simple, right?

Wrong. Naughty Dog does something BOLD mid-game: forces you to play as the person Ellie is hunting. You play 10-12 hours as Abby, the "antagonist". And gradually... you start to understand. To empathize. To question everything. 😰

**First playthrough (2020):**
- Hated playing as Abby
- Didn't want to understand her side
- Ending felt weak

**Second playthrough (2022):**
- Abby's arc is brilliant (especially with Lev)
- Narrative structure makes SENSE
- Ending is perfect - shows revenge brings no peace 😢

### Why It Works Better the Second Time?

When you know where the story goes, you appreciate the nuances. The parallels between Ellie and Abby. The small choices that matter. The message about the cycle of violence.

First time: "Why am I doing this?"
Second time: "OH, THAT'S WHY. Genius." 💡

## Gameplay: Evolved Stealth + Brutal Combat 🎮

**Rating: 9.5/10**

TLOU1 combat was good. TLOU2 is MASTERFUL.

**Improvements:**
- **Prone** (lie down) - Changes everything for stealth
- **Dodge** - Much more dynamic melee combat
- **Improved AI** - Enemies call each other by name (😱), flank, search intelligently
- **Destructible environments** - Glass breaks, wood explodes
- **70+ accessibility options** - Most accessible game ever

**Enemy encounters:**
- Humans (WLF, Seraphites) - Tactical, difficult
- Infected (Clickers, Shamblers, **RAT KING** 😱) - Pure horror
- Mix of both - Total chaos!

## Technical Aspects: Visual Reference 🎨

**Graphics: 10/10**
- PS5 version: 4K/60fps (HUGE difference!)
- Facial animations: BEST in any game
- Lighting: Photorealistic

**Audio: 10/10**
- Gustavo Santaolalla returns
- Voice acting: Ashley Johnson (Ellie) + Laura Bailey (Abby) = OSCAR-LEVEL

**PS5 Performance:**
- Solid 60fps always
- Load times: ~5 seconds (vs 30s+ on PS4!)
- Zero bugs (32 hours)

## Pros & Cons ✅❌

### What I LOVED (Replay): ✅

1. **Courageous narrative** - Takes risks and DELIVERS
2. **Abby's arc** - Better than expected
3. **Combat & stealth** - Best of PS4 generation
4. **Unbelievable graphics** - Photorealism
5. **Accessibility** - Game for EVERYONE
6. **60fps on PS5** - Game changer vs PS4/30fps

### What Still Bothers Me: ❌

1. **Pacing** - 25h is LONG, has slow moments
2. **Structure** - Ellie/Abby swap is jarring
3. **Ending** - I understand the message but still bittersweet

## Comparison TLOU1 vs TLOU2 🤔

| Aspect | TLOU1 | TLOU2 |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Story | 10/10 (perfect) | 9/10 (divisive but brilliant) |
| Gameplay | 8/10 | 9.5/10 |
| Graphics | 9/10 | 10/10 |
| **OVERALL** | **9.5/10** | **9/10** |

TLOU1 is perfect masterpiece. TLOU2 is IMPERFECT masterpiece - more ambitious, riskier, doesn't please everyone. 🙏

## Final Verdict (2022) 🎯

3 years later, with cool head, changed perspective:

**The Last of Us Part II is one of the best experiences in video games.** Not perfect. Won't please everyone. BUT it's art. Art that provokes, questions, disturbs.

First playthrough (2020): 6/10 (anger, disappointment)
Second playthrough (2022): **9/10** (respect, admiration)

**Lesson learned:** Sometimes, games (like films, books) need time to settle. Giving it a second chance was one of my best gaming decisions. 💭

---

**Final Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (9/10)**

**Recommended for:**
- TLOU1 fans (WITH OPEN MIND!)
- Lovers of storytelling in games
- Those who appreciate mature, complex narratives

**NOT recommended for:**
- Those wanting "feel-good" story (this is HEAVY)
- Who can't stand slow narratives

**Will you cry?** Yes. A lot. Prepare tissues. 😭

**"Endure and survive."** 🌿
