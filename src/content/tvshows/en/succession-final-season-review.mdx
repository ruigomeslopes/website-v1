# Succession: Perfect Corporate Shakespeare

**Creator:** Jesse Armstrong | **4 seasons:** 39 episodes | **Platform:** HBO Max
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Rating: 5/5**

---

**It's over.** And what an ending. 😭

**Roy Family = Shakespearean tragedy:** Logan Roy = tyrannical King Lear. Kendall, Roman, Shiv = psychologically destroyed children.

**Sharp writing:** Dialogues are ART. "Fuck off" has 50 variations. 😅

**Final Season S4:**
- Episode 3 ("Connor's Wedding"): Logan dies. DEVASTATING. 💔
- Episode 10 (Finale): Perfect. Bitter. Real.

**Nobody wins. Everyone loses.** That's brilliance. 👏

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **(5/5)** - Series of the decade!
